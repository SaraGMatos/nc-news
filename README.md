# NC NEWS

## What is this?

This is a web application that allows users to access the _NC News_ platform, a site similar to Reddit where users can, for now, read articles, vote them, and post and vote comments.

_NC News_ is also the front-end result of a full-stack project (feel free to have a look at our [API](https://github.com/SaraGMatos/backend-project)) and has been developed using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/).

Would you like to have a look at the Netlify hosted version? Have a peek [here](https://my-ncnews.netlify.app/). Please note that our server spins down with inactivity and it can take about 50 seconds to get it back up again.

## Want to run this locally?

1. Please make sure that you have at least the following _Node.js_ version:

   - v21.6.1

2. If you do not have _Node.js_ installed on your machine, please follow [the installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs).

3. Clone this repository by pasting the following on your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/SaraGMatos/nc-news`.

4. Once you are in the project folder, install node package manager (npm) to set up needed dependencies. Paste this on your terminal: `npm install`.

5. Now you should be ready to run it locally using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) as a dev server. Please paste the following: `npm run dev` and click on the `http://localhost:5173/` that will appear on your terminal!

## Contributions

This project is open to contributions. Feel free to submit a pull request if you would like to make a suggestion or raise an issue or problem with the code.

## Final note

This project was developed as a week-long front-end review during the Software Delopment bootcamp at Northcoders. It is still a work in progress (as is learning!) and new features and improvements to code base, UI and UX will be likely to be implemented in the near future.
